# Contributing

Thank you for your time to contributing this project!

Any contribution are welcome, whether it's just a small code changes or just
giving a star to the repository.

Here are some contribution you can do:

- Add new theme
- Improve code quality
- Improve website UI
- Improve README or Fix Typos

See [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute) section to guide you how to
contribute this project.

## Add New Theme

There is some theme that are already available:

- [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) (main and Dawn theme)
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) (Mocha theme)
- [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)

To add a new theme, copy the
[default theme in JSON](assets/themes/default.json) and change the file name
to the exact theme name like `catppuccin-mocha.json` for example. And then
change the hex color code inside JSON to your color theme with the
appropriate key.

In `index.html`, add new theme option in `select` element, it's grouped between
dark and light theme, so you need to place the right color theme. And add `value`
attribute with the value of the file name. For example, if the file name of
the theme is `catppuccin-mocha.json`, then the value of `value` attribute
is `catppuccin-mocha`. So make sure the value of `value` attribute is the exact
same as the file name (without `.json`).

Here is the example:

```html
<select id="themes">
  <optgroup label="Dark Theme">
    <option value="default" selected>Default</option>
    <option value="rose-pine">Rose Pine</option>
    <option value="catppuccin-mocha">Catppuccin Mocha</option>
    <! -- Add your new dark theme here -->
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="Light Theme">
    <option value="rose-pine-dawn">Rose Pine Dawn</option>
    <! -- Add your new light theme here -->
  </optgroup>
</select>
```

## Improve Code Quality

The code is really messy. Since lack of knowledge, it's just "works".
Any improvement for code quality are very appreciated to making a cleaner,
minimal, and readable code.

## Improve Website UI

By now, the UI are just a copy of the
[original website](https://thomashunter.name/i3-configurator) with a little
responsive. Any UI improvement is welcome to make it more minimal and
easier to navigate.

## Improve README or Fix Typos

have found some typo or grammar mistake. Small changes like typos or improving
the README are also helped the others to understand the context.
